# AI Daily Planner

The **AI Daily Planner** is a Flask-based scheduling application that uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate personalized daily schedules. The app offers two scheduling modesâ€”one that plans from the current time for "Today" and another that generates a full-day schedule for "Tomorrow". All generated schedules are stored in a local SQLite database and displayed using a modern Bootstrap-based UI.

## Features

- **Dynamic Scheduling:**  
  Choose between generating a schedule starting from the current time ("Today") or a full schedule for the next day ("Tomorrow").

- **AI-Powered Plan Generation:**  
  Uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to create a structured and personalized schedule based on your input.

- **Local Persistence:**  
  Schedules are saved in a SQLite database and displayed as cards on the web interface.

- **Modern UI:**  
  Built with Bootstrap 5 for a clean and responsive design.
